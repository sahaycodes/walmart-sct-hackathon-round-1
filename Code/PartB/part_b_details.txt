Clarke & Wright Savings algorithm: The savings algorithm was used to calculate the initial routes for each vehicle. This algorithm is a greedy heuristic that starts with a set of routes, where each route consists of a single customer location. It then iteratively combines the closest pair of routes into a single route if the combined distance is less than the sum of the individual distances. This process is repeated until no more routes can be combined. The savings algorithm is commonly used in vehicle routing problems to generate initial routes that are close to optimal.

2-opt algorithm: The 2-opt algorithm was used to improve the initial routes generated by the savings algorithm. This algorithm is a local search algorithm that tries to improve the current solution by swapping two edges in the route. If the new route has a lower total distance, it becomes the new current solution. This process is repeated until no more improvements can be made. The 2-opt algorithm is commonly used in vehicle routing problems to fine-tune the initial routes and find a better solution.
